          My name is <b>Adedayo Odunsi.</b> <br />I love technology because it
          makes life easier, it provides quick solutions to needs and
          helps people scale their solutions to meet the needs of a larger
          audience. <br> For instance with technology, people all over the
          world can have access to health related apps, finance apps, etc
          and they can learn new skills from anywhere <br />in the world without
          visiting a physical classroom - just like I how I am currently
          learning Software Development <br />online at <i>Stutern.</i> Indeed
          Technology has made the world a global village.

          <b>CSS</b> stands for <i>Cascading Style Sheets.</i> It is a styling
          language used alongside html to make webpages look more beautiful and
          appealing.There are three types or methods of CSS namely
          <i>In line CSS sytling, internal CSS styling and external CSS
            styling.</i>
          <br>The <b>In line CSS</b> is used within the opening tag of an HTML
          Element. To style a HTML file using <b>Internal CSS</b>, a style tag
          has to be used within the head element just after the title tag. <br>The
          <b>External CSS</b> involves making use of an external CSS file to
          style the HTML page. The CSS file is linked to the html page using a
          link in the head section of the HTML page. Also CSS involves the use
          of 5 selectors namely: Universal, Element, ID, Class and Class
          Attribute selector.

          In <b> CSS styling </b>, it is very important to know the difference
          between <i>paddings, margins and borders.</i>The
          <i>CSS Box Model</i> controls Paddings, Borders and Margins. <br /><b
            >Paddings</b> are used to generate or create a space between an element's content
          and its borders. <br /><b>Margins</b> on the other hand are the spaces
          outside an element's border. The Margin controls the space
          <br />outside an element while padding controls the space within an
          element. <br />A <b> Border</b> is used to create a visible line or
          frame around the element it is applied to and it is used to set a
          border on an element.
